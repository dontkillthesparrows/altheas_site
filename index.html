            <p>
              I have been a passionate creator since childhood. Driven by
              curiosity and aesthetics, I have pushed myself to learn new
              techniques to be able to create new things and solve interesting
              problems. I have just switched careers to the
              IT/technology-industry after a pretty intense course in
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
                target="_blank"
                >JavaScript</a
              >
              and general frontend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my career in the clothing industry. I studied textile
              design and pattern making and later
              <abbr title="Computer-aided design">CAD</abbr> pattern making for
              mass industry. The years went by and I ended up in an interesting
              job working with the more technical aspects of development of
              technical clothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the beginning my focus were the fit and sizing of the garments
              and quality control of the textiles. This eventually brought me
              physically down our value chain, travelling to our suppliers and
              factories, following our value chain from yarn to weaving, dyeing,
              membrane bonding, pattern making and the creation of the finished
              garment. This made me realize just how complex product development
              really is.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also worked with problems related to corporate social
              responsibility and compliance mainly related to chemical use in
              the textile industry. I learned about the importance of a good
              dialogue with all parties, not just to ensure a good product in
              our end, but also to make sure that all the people in the value
              chain were well taken care of in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a journey that really enhanced my ability of abstract
              analytical thinking – but I missed something important in my life.
              I missed to create things with my hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day I got the opportunity to change my career in a new and
              exciting direction. I applied to a
              <a
                href="https://www.academicwork.no/om-oss/academy"
                target="_blank"
                >JavaScript-course</a
              >
              and got accepted. We were 15 in my class – selected from over 2000
              applicants. That was one of the best decisions of my life, because
              it led me to find a new way of creation. And I learned that
              nothing makes me happier than finding elegant solutions both in
              code and in user experience.
            </p>
